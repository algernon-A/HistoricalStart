## Historical Start
A mod for Cities: Skylines 2.  Available for download only on [Paradox Mods](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74535/Windows).

The primary platform for support is the [Cities Skylines Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/HTav7ARPs2).

### Features
Enables more historical city building when using the game's unlocking progression system by unlocking selected categories at the start of a game.  These categories can be set in the mod's options panel and include:
1. **Buses**
1. **Trams**
1. **Rail** (enabled by default)
1. **Shipping** (enabled by default)
1. **Small highways** (2- and 3-lane two-way highways, enabled by default)
1. **All highways**
1. **Advanced farming** (vegetables and cotton)
1. **Mining*** (coal and ore)
1. **Oil drilling**

Supporting features will also be unlocked where appropriate, for example:
1. The **Transportation budget**
1. The **Natural Resources Infoview**
1. The **Transport routes overview**

When a public transport category is unlocked, this mod also makes it possible to place infrastructure **without needing to build a depot first** (a depot will still be needed at some point if you wish to run transport lines).

This makes it much easier to lay out and grow a city that historically would have been founded prior to the automobile era, and enables you to properly utilize the transportation networks and/or industries those cities would have been originally founded for and developed around.

To (partially) offset any unlocks, the XP gains for unlocked items will be reduced by 90%, and you will also still need to manually unlock (and spend the point for) the relevant progression node in the progression tree if you want to unlock the subsequent nodes.		

### Instructions
Rail, shipping, and basic highways will be unlocked by default when you install the mod.  These can be disabled (and/or other categories enabled) in the mod's options menu entry.

## Meta
Safe to remove at any time.  Anything that's been unlocked in a save will remain unlocked for that save.

### Translations
