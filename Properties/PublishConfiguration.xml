  <LongDescription>Enables more historical city building when using the game's unlocking progression system by unlocking from the start of the game:
1. **Rail**
1. **Shipping**
1. **Specialized Industry** (farming/mining/logging)
1. **Budgeting** and the production overview

Also enables placement of **train stations** and **cargo terminals** without having to place a depot first.

This makes it much easier to lay out and grow a city that historically would have been founded prior to the automobile era, and enables you to properly utilize the transportation networks and/or industries those cities would have been originally founded for and developed around.

To (partially) offset this the XP gains for these items have been reduced by 90%, and you will also still need to manually unlock (and spend the point for) the 'Train' progression node in the transportation progression tree if you want to unlock the subsequent nodes.		

## Instructions
None needed - simply install the mod!  Rail and shipping should be unlocked automatically.
